# Bobnow's fan fiction reader
I wanted to get into reading fan fiction but I happen to have a attention span barely enough to read a user manual.
So I made this jank abomination of a program. Reading is for nerds anyway
## Current features:
1. Colored text in the menus
2. Text to speech
3. Semi automatic downloads from AO3
4. Input safety (Still jank tho)
5. Pick up where you left off (autosave progression every sentance, will break if the writer changes previous chapters)
6. Multiplatform support? (Windows support untested, unix-like works.(At least on Arch))
## Guide for Windows:
1. Run "setup.ps1" to set up.
2. Run "start.ps1" to run the program.
May not work lol
## Guide for Linux
1. Run "setup.sh" to set up.
2. Run "start.sh" to run the program.
## Guide for Mac
Good luck :D
## WARNING! THIS IS JANK AND MAY BREAK AT ANY TIME IN ANY WAY. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IT MAY OR MAY NOT DO TO YOUR POOR COMPUTER.
